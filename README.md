# Login-Application
This is a simple login application which will help you to deal with a database. This application has developed based on N-Tier architecture and C# is the core language of this project. When it comes to N-Tier architecture, it is an industry-proved software architecture model, suitable to support enterprise-level client/server applications by resolving issues like scalability, security, fault tolerance and etc. .NET has many tools and features, but .NET doesnâ€™t have pre-defined ways to guard how to implement N-Tier architecture. Therefore, in order to achieve good design and implementation of N-Tier architecture in .NET, understanding fully its concepts is very important In here I have used 3-Tier architecture, the simplest of N-Tier architecture which contains Presentation layer, Business/application layer, Data layer with a shared layer called object library.
